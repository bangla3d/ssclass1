            My Name is Mahmudur Rahman
        </h1>
        <h2>
            My last job Title was 3D Visualizer(Architechural)
        </h2>

            And I am quite old! Yeah,very Old!!
        </h3>
        <p>
            I took Economics as my Graduation course, but got myself out of it in the 2nd year,cause I found it absurd for me to study something that I NEVER liked (It was from Calcutta University,and I still wonder,why the hell I went there at the first place!)<strong> Shame on me!!</strong>.
            
        <p>I did so many things in my life,but never did anything for long period till 2004. Thats the time when I went to Bombay and did a 2 year Diploma in Multimedia. I did that course,since it was kind of new and fun to do,and I was very keen.I have been into 3d Visualization since 2006. Worked for various companies and Ad Agencies in Dhaka till 2013.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>After doing the jobs with few companies, I thought I could render my services through online platforms and can earn a little more,and hence I joined upwork.
            I have worked in upwork in about 120+ projects. I joined peopleperhour and guru while working in upwork and was doing OK. At one point I found myself working with clients directlty and things were getting even better....
        </p>
        <p>
            ...Until I found myself losing clients during the Pandemic, when it all started to go down for me from the mid of 2020!
        </p>
        <p>
            By July 2021, I found myself completely alone and lost my livelihood! Also lost interest by the uncertainity in 3D Visualization industry/community and its been 15 years by 2021,and my longest career in one single NICHE! I have had enough !!
        </p>
        <p>
            I was trying to find something to learn and give life a NEW starting for the last one year,but couldnt find anything that will create any interest in me. Then I came to know about Shopify and thought I could use some of my graphic design knowledge to persue this career. But later I learned that I will need some coding knowledge,which I didnt have. And then I started to look for a place that could teach me how.
        </p>
        <p>
            And during this search,I came across some of your youtube tutorials in codexcode channel and found it fascinating the way you teach.<br> I truly think I will be able to learn from you valuable, since your teaching style is very elegant. Not everyone can be a good teacher and I have tried several other youtube channels of Bangladeshis. Its because of your videos, I started learning HTML and CSS from last month. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If I can finish this course well, I plan to re-start my freelancing career again with upwork and in Shopify. And if all things go right, I will continue to stay with Shikhbe Shobai and learn some more skills to grow more. I would also be happy to share any knowledge/experience I gained from working in architectural 3D visualization if need be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did not have a plan to write this big. But I thought you should also know a bit about me,since I plan to stay for long. I do appreciate you have read this much. Thank you  very much and
        </p>
        <p>
            Look forward to See you soon in the next class :-)
